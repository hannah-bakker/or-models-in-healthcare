    "\n",
    "In this case study, you will implement **the maximal coverage location model** to optimize hospital placement in **Northern Baden-Württemberg**. Given a dataset containing:\n",
    "1. **Towns with more than 25,000 inhabitants**, which are potential hospital locations.\n",
    "3. **Travel times (in minutes) between towns** as a measure of accessibility.\n",

    "  <img src=\"../data/cities_north_bw.png\" alt=\"Hospitals in Northern Baden-Württemberg\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "As a starting point, we assume that the entire hospital network is to be revised and existing locations can be ignored entirely. \n",
    "Your objective is to **model and solve this as a Maximum Coverage Location Problem (MCLP) using SCIP**. This means that:\n",
    "- A **hospital can be built in any town** from the dataset.\n",
    "- A **hospital provides coverage** to the population of a town if it is within a predefined travel time of a town.\n",
    "- The **goal is to place a limited number of hospitals** to **maximize the number of covered towns**.\n",

    "- $ J $ as the set of **demand locations** (towns needing coverage, indexed by $ j $).\n",
    "- $ I $ as the set of **potential hospital locations** (indexed by $ i $).\n",
    "- $ p $ as the **maximum number of hospitals that can be built**.\n",
    "- $ a_{ij} $ as a **binary parameter**:\n",
    "  - $ a_{ij} = 1 $ if hospital $ i $ can cover town $ j $ (within a given travel time threshold).\n",
    "  - $ a_{ij} = 0 $ otherwise.\n",
    "- $ w_{j} $ as the population living in town $ j $.\n",
    "- $ y_i $ as a **binary decision variable**:\n",
    "  - $ y_i = 1 $ if a hospital is built in town $ i $.\n",
    "  - $ y_i = 0 $ otherwise.\n",
    "- $ x_j $ as a **binary variable**:\n",
    "  - $ x_j = 1 $ if town $ i $ is covered by at least one hospital.\n",
    "  - $ x_j = 0 $ otherwise.\n",
